Before start make .env file: 
API_URL=http://localhost:4200

`4200` is the port for json-server. 
You can change it in the package.json `mock` script

For start use command
`npm run serve`

Used technologies:

<li>React</li>
<li>Next js</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>json-server for BE side mocks</li>
